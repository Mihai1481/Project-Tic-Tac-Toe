This project is part of the The Odin Project curriculum, specifically the JavaScript section. The goal was to create an interactive Tic Tac Toe game using fundamental concepts of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Description

This project implements a simple Tic Tac Toe game where two players can take turns playing on the same screen.

The game features:

    Player alternation (X and O).
    Automatic checking for a winner or a tie after each move.
    A reset option to start a new game.
    Requirements and Objectives
    To complete this project, I had to:

Build the user interface:

    Designed a 3x3 game grid using HTML and CSS with a clean and minimalist look.
    Added buttons for resetting the game and displaying game status messages.
    Apply JavaScript concepts:

    Organized the code using JavaScript modules.
    Handled game logic, including checking winning combinations and switching turns.
    Implemented functions to update the UI dynamically based on user interactions.

Lessons Learned:

    How to efficiently manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
    The importance of separating application logic from the user interface.
    Leveraging arrays and conditions to check for winning combinations.
